![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hackerschool/community.svg?branch=master)

## Dependencies

- Ruby 2.1.5
  - bundler
  - foreman
- Postgres 9.3.5
- redis
- leiningen
- Elasticsearch

### Installing dependencies on OS X using rvm, Homebrew, and Postgres.app

We recommend [Postgres.app](http://postgresapp.com/) if you're on OS X.

**Ruby stuff using rvm:**

```sh
$ rvm get stable
$ rvm install ruby-2.1.5
$ rvm use ruby-2.1.5
$ gem install bundler
$ gem install foreman
```

**Leiningen and redis using Homebrew:**

```sh
$ brew update
$ brew install leiningen redis elasticsearch
# follow the printed instructions to have redis and elasticsearch start automatically on boot
```

## Configuration

We use foreman which sets environment variables from a `.env` file. We don't
check this into version control because it contains secret information. Here is
a sample `.env` file to get you started:

```sh
PORT=5001
RACK_ENV=development
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

HACKER_SCHOOL_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
HACKER_SCHOOL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

JASMINE_CONFIG_PATH=test/javascripts/support/jasmine.yml

# If you want to import accounts from Hacker School
# (You won't be able to do this unless you are Hacker School faculty)
# HACKER_SCHOOL_API_SECRET_TOKEN=hacker_school_api_secret

# If you want to develop against a local copy of the Hacker School API, add:
# HACKER_SCHOOL_SITE=http://localhost:5000

# Needed for batch mail sending in production
# MAILGUN_API_KEY=your_mailgun_api_key
```

To generate a Hacker School client id and secret, go to your [Hacker School settings page](https://www.hackerschool.com/settings) and make a new OAuth app. The redirect url should be `http://localhost:5001/login/complete` (or your development host name if you don't develop off of localhost).

## Running the code

The first time you run the code, install necessary gems and set up your database.

```sh
$ bundle
$ bin/rake db:setup
```

After that, start your development server and start building the client JS.

```sh
$ foreman start

# In another terminal:
$ cd client
$ lein cljsbuild auto
```

### Running the production ClojureScript

The production client code will sometimes function differently than the development code. This can happen when you forget to add externs for a library you are calling, or if `lein cljsbuild auto` randomly makes a bad client. Because of this, we should test the production client before deploying. To do that, you can set `CLIENT_ENV` to production and run Foreman. If you don't set CLIENT_ENV, it defaults to the Rails environment.

```sh
$ CLIENT_ENV=production foreman start
```

## Where is `db/schema.rb`?

Look at `db/structure.sql` instead. We use this because it supports Postgres views.

## Client testing

We use a small ClojureScript wrapper over [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html) for testing our client. If you're running `lein cljsbuild auto` (as above), the client tests will be built automatically.

To run the client tests:

```sh
$ bin/rake jasmine
# Navigate to localhost:8888 to run the tests.
# Refresh the page to re-run the tests.
```
